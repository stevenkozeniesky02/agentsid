## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Codex's guard MCP no longer times out on first run.** The 10s `startup_timeout_sec` we were writing into `config.toml` was Codex's own default, but it's too tight for a cold `npx -y @agentsid/guard` that has to fetch the package and its `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency (~2MB combined). First launch after `@agentsid/guard@0.1.1` landed on npm was hitting the 10s wall and failing with *"MCP client for agentsid timed out after 10 seconds"*. Subsequent launches hit the npx cache and are instant.
- Bumped to 30s — safe headroom for fresh-install downloads while still fast enough that a genuinely hung server shows up as a failure in a reasonable time.

### Notes
- No changes to the guard package itself; this is purely a Codex-side config adjustment.
- The `agentsid` MCP should now come up green on Codex after the wizard completes. If it still shows the timeout warning after 0.2.2, either the user's network is slow enough to exceed 30s on first fetch (edge case — they can bump further in `~/.codex/config.toml`) or there's a real bug in the guard.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Codex no longer refuses to boot when `@agentsid/guard` can't start.** 0.2.0 set `required = true` on the guard MCP server, which was correct posture for a known-good guard package — but `@agentsid/guard` has never actually been published to npm. Every 0.2.0 Codex user hit `Error: thread/start failed during TUI bootstrap` because Codex dutifully failed-closed on the MCP's `npm 404 Not Found`. Flipping to `required = false` restores boot; the kernel sandbox (`sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` + `network_access = false`) is still active and still Codex's primary enforcement layer. This matches how Cursor and Claude Code already handle the same failure mode — red MCP badge, app still runs.

### Notes
- Cursor and Claude Code users were also receiving an MCP config pointing at the unpublished package. It silently failed on those platforms (no `required` field) so they just saw a red agentsid-MCP badge and kept running — losing only the guard-MCP tool surface, not the hook-based enforcement which is the primary mechanism on those platforms.
- The real fix is to actually publish `@agentsid/guard`. Tracking as a separate deliverable: the package exists at `mcp-shell-guard/` in the monorepo (name = `@agentsid/guard`, v0.1.0) but needs audit + tests + publish workflow before going live.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-20

Minor version bump — Codex promoted from "in testing" to stable. Three of five supported platforms now ship with real enforcement; the multi-provider story holds.

### Added
- **Codex kernel-sandbox is now written, not just recommended.** Previous versions' wizard printed a recommendation that the user manually set `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` with `network_access = false` in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Every user who skimmed the output missed that — Codex's primary enforcement layer stayed off. 0.2.0 writes both directly into `config.toml`:
  - `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` (top-level scalar — kernel-level, blocks system paths + privilege escalation)
  - `[sandbox_workspace_write] network_access = false` (nested table — blocks outbound network from inside the sandbox)
- `serializeToml` now handles top-level scalars and generic `[table]` sections, not just `[mcp_servers.<name>]`. Booleans serialise as native TOML bools; arrays serialise correctly. Six new test cases pin this behaviour.
- Codex integration tests for the new sandbox-config output (4 new cases).

### Changed
- Codex platform promoted from "(in testing)" to stable in both the wizard's platform picker ([src/steps/platform.tsx](setup/src/steps/platform.tsx)) and the README support matrix. Three of five platforms now stable: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex.
- Codex integration instructions rewritten — no longer says "also set this manually" since the wizard now sets it. Still documents the network-access override for workflows that genuinely need outbound HTTP.

### Notes
- Codex hooks remain opt-in and experimental behind `enableCodexHooks`. Hook parity with Cursor's adapter pattern is deferred; the sandbox + guard MCP combo reaches stable-grade enforcement without it.
- Existing agents created by 0.1.x wizards will NOT automatically pick up the sandbox config — users who want the sandbox enabled should re-run the wizard so a fresh `~/.codex/config.toml` gets written.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Block SSH private key reads.** New `DENY_SSH_KEY` rule (`file.read[ssh_key]`) in both the Developer and Security-Team presets, gated on the canonical private-key filenames (`id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_dsa`). Public keys (`id_rsa.pub` etc.) still fall through to normal reads. Classifier already emits the matching `file.read[ssh_key]` tag (shipped in the 0.1.3 server deploy), so no server change needed.
- **Block PFX / P12 cert bundle reads.** New `DENY_PFX_FILE` rule (`file.read[*.pfx]`) added alongside the existing `.pem` / `.key` denies. PFX/P12 files usually contain a private key alongside the cert chain, so belong in the same sensitivity class.
- New wizard toggle `credentials.ssh` — defaults ON — lets users opt out of the SSH-key block if they really need agents to read private keys (don't).

### Changed
- `credentials.pem` toggle label and description now reflect the broader PFX/P12 coverage.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Developer and security-team presets now cover every `.env*` variant.** The deny rule for `file.read[.env]` previously shipped with `conditions: { path_pattern: ".env" }` — an exact match. Reading `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.staging`, `.env.test`, or any other `.env.*` variant fell through to the `*` allow fallback, even though those files typically hold the most sensitive secrets. The rule now uses `conditions: { path_pattern: [".env", ".env.*"] }` which is glob-matched server-side against the file_path.
- No client-side behaviour change required — the condition loop in `server/src/services/permission.py::_matches_conditions` already handles list-of-patterns in its `path_pattern` special case (shipped 2026-04-20).

## [0.1.4] — 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Cursor integration promoted from "in testing" to stable. Live-verified in 0.1.3 end-to-end against `api.agentsid.dev` with real Cursor 1.7+ hooks: `beforeShellExecution` / `beforeMCPExecution` / `beforeReadFile` all fire with correct protocol, deny reasons surface in Cursor's UI, and `agent_message` reaches the LLM. README and platform selector in the wizard both updated — the "Cursor (in testing)" label is gone.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Cursor integration now actually enforces policy.** Previously the wizard emitted a `hooks.json` that pointed at Claude Code's `pre-tool.sh`, which silently no-oped on Cursor in three ways: (a) it emitted Claude-Code-format decisions (`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`) that Cursor ignores in favour of `{"permission":"deny","user_message","agent_message"}`; (b) it expected `tool_name` in stdin, which `beforeShellExecution` and `beforeReadFile` don't provide, so the script bailed out allow on every shell exec and file read; (c) credentials were parked on a `sessionStart` entry's `env` field, which Cursor does not read — env only flows from `sessionStart` hook stdout. Every deny was silently dropped. Users who installed 0.1.2 on Cursor had zero enforcement.

### Added
- `cursor-adapter.sh` — single script with `shell`/`mcp`/`read`/`audit` sub-commands that translates Cursor's per-event stdin shapes into `/validate` calls and emits Cursor-format permission decisions. Sources credentials from `~/.agentsid/cursor-env.json` (chmod 600).
- `~/.agentsid/cursor-env.json` — global, mode-600 credential file used by the Cursor adapter.
- `IntegrationOptions` for per-wizard toggles (`enableCodexHooks`, `enableCursorPermissions`), default OFF.
- `PlatformIntegration.additionalFiles()` — integrations can now emit sibling config files (hooks.json, env files, permissions.json) alongside the primary config, with optional POSIX `mode` for secret files.
- Codex: mark AgentsID MCP server as `required = true` with startup/tool timeouts so Codex surfaces guard failures instead of silently running unguarded.
- Codex: opt-in `enableCodexHooks` flag emits an experimental Bash-only `hooks.json`. Off by default because Codex hooks are still experimental.
- Codex: setup instructions now mention the `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` + `network_access = false` recommendation — that's Codex's own primary enforcement layer.
- 11 new integration tests that spawn `cursor-adapter.sh` against a real HTTP mock, locking down the Cursor protocol contract (deny shape, stdin fields per event, env loading, fail-open on network error, injection safety on deny reason).

### Changed
- Cursor `hooks.json` now registers `beforeShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, `beforeReadFile`, and the three `after*` audit hooks. No longer registers `preToolUse` (redundant with the before-specific hooks) or `sessionStart` (its env-injection trick didn't work).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Claude Code integration now writes `AGENTSID_PROJECT_KEY`, `AGENTSID_AGENT_TOKEN`, `AGENTSID_AGENT_ID`, and `AGENTSID_API_URL` into the **top-level `env` block** of `.claude/settings.json`, not just `mcpServers.agentsid.env`. The PreToolUse hook reads from the top-level env block (that's where Claude Code injects hook-process environment). Previously, the hook would exit silently on every invocation because those vars were absent — effectively making AgentsID a no-op after setup.
- `IntegrationConfig` now carries optional `agentId` and `apiUrl` so the integration can populate the full env block.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Hook shell scripts (`pre-tool.sh`, `post-tool.sh`) were not bundled into `dist/` during build, causing `installHook()` to fail with "Hook source file not found" when installed from the published tarball. Build now copies `src/hook/*.sh` into `dist/hook/`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- Initial release. Interactive Ink-based CLI wizard.
- 5-step flow: platform → auth → persona → policies → hook install.
- Three built-in presets: Developer, Security Team, Lockdown.
- Claude Code integration (stable). Cursor/Codex/Gemini/local model (in testing).
- Installs `pre-tool.sh` with:
  - `/api/v1/validate` gating for every tool call
  - `/api/v1/agents/derive` on subagent (Agent/Task) spawn
  - Just-in-time child token derivation with local cache for real-time per-subagent enforcement
  - Shell-injection-safe stdin handling
- npm provenance attestations on every published version.
